# Qubo formulation of Feature Selection Problem

This repository contains a Qubo formulation problem to assess **Feature Selection** in classical Machine Learning frameworks.
It contians files to handle a structured dataset (*breast cancer* dataset provided by *Scikit-Learn* is used), to create and evaluating the **Redundancy** and **Importance** matrices constructed from the **Mutual and Conditional Mutual Information** between features and labels. Subsequently, the symmetric $NxN$ QUBO matrix is constructed.
